# Julia-Set-and-L-Systems

1) Multi-Julia Set - Using JavaX & JavaSE toolkit to take a complex number and "n"(power) as an input which creates a raster of pixels intensities determining the Julia set(Fractal) form.

2) L-System - Using JavaX & JavaSE toolkit to take a String and diverging angle as inputs which determines the structure of L-system.

Call the JuliaLSys class as it's the main driver.

The Structural hierachy is as shown below -
